# Potato_Disease_Classifer_CNN
Potato leaf disease classification using DL CNNs

This Deep learning model is based on Potato Leaf Disease Dataset you can find it on kaggle.

The model is fed with images of potato leaf being at one of three conditions (three classes)
	1. Healthy
	2. Early Blight
	3. Late Blight
and the model shoud learn to classify those images.

The model is implemented with Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs)
